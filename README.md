# TripPlanner

## This is my first Java Project

### The Goal of this project is to provide the user with a way to communicate with the program to allow them to plan for a trip. This project uses the Java Scanner tool to allow the user to input information, and then the project uses that information to help the user plan an international trip.


#### This project introduced the Scanner tool and allowed for user input in the terminal.
